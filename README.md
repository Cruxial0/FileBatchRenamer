# FileBatchRenamerPerformance (maybe)
utility for renaming a batch of files using the same name pattern. Useful for renaming .png sequences.

This program allows you to select a batch of files, and rename them using the same output name pattern. Contains a pretty neat, but slow logging system.

Forked from Cruxial0 to try to imporve performance
